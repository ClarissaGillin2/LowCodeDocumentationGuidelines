# Contributing Guidance

If you'd like to contribute to this repository, please read the following guidelines. We want to make sure that everyone gets the most out of their efforts. 

## Code of Conduct

This project has adopted the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct, for more information, see the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/). 

## Question or Problem?

Please use proper issues for bug reports, documentation fix, feature requests and general feedback. This way we can more easily track actual bugs from the code and help get things fixed. 

## Typos, Issues, Bugs and contributions

Please follow these recommendations.

* Always fork repository to your own account for applying modifications
* Do not combine multiple changes to one PR, please submit for example any samples and documentation updates using separate PRs
* If you are submitting typo or documentation fix, you can combine modifications to single PR where suitable

## Submitting changes as pull requests

Here's a high level process for submitting new samples or updates to existing ones.

1. Fork the main repository to your GitHub account
2. Include your changes to your branch
3. Commit your changes using descriptive commit message - These are used to track changes on the repositories for bi-weekly communications
4. Create a pull request in your own fork and target 'main' branch
5. Fill up the provided PR template with the requested details

> note. Delete the feature specific branch only AFTER your PR has been processed.
